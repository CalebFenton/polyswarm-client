    About <self>


``polyswarm-client`` is a convenient library on which to build PolySwarm market participants.

Here you'll find auto-generated documentation based on the ``polyswarm-client`` source code.
This may be useful for developers interested in the low-level details of ``polyswarm-client`` implementation.
Such developers should navigate to "API Reference" over to the left.

Consulting these low level details is unnecessary for developing a successful PolySwarm participant.
Most users will instead want to consult the `PolySwarm Documentation <https://docs.polyswarm.io>`_.
