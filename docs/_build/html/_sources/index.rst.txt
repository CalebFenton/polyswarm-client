What is PolySwarm Client?
=========================

This is a WIP client library to simplify interacting with a `polyswarmd <https://github.com/polyswarm/polyswarmd>`_ instance from Python.

This documentation consists of the base `polyswarm-client` which can be found in the *PolySwarm Client Module* section, and the example
drivers. These consist of *Ambassador*, *Arbiter*, and *Microengine*. 

Check out the `PolySwarm Docs <https://docs.polyswarm.io>`_ for more information on how to get started.
